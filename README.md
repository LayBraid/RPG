# RPGrrr

The goal of this project is to create our own *RPG game* in **C**, using the **CSFML** library.

We based our RPG on the very legendary `The Legend of Zelda` license.

## Usage

*To compile the game, you'll need the SFML installed on your PC and the CSFML binding of it.*<br>
Get in the directory and use the `make` command in your terminal.<br>Then just type `./my_rpg` and you're good to go !
